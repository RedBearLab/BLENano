This repository contains the resources for the BLE Nano development board and the MK20 or DAPLink USB interface dongle.

The BLE Nano is compatible to Arduino (but not 100%) and allows you to use the Arduino IDE for development. Also, it supports mbed online development.

For Arduino, please refer to this repo.: [nRF51822-Arduino](https://github.com/RedBearLab/nRF51822-Arduino/)

For mbed, please visit, [mbed for BLE Nano](https://developer.mbed.org/platforms/RedBearLab-BLE-Nano/).

It targets for makers, engineers and students to develop low power Internet-Of-Things (IoT) projects/prototypes quickly and easily.
