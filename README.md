This repository contains the resources for the BLE Nano development board and the MK20 or DAPLink USB interface dongle.

This board is compatible to Arduino (but not 100%) and it supports Arduino IDE for development. Also, it supports [mbed](http://developer.mbed.org/platforms/RedBearLab-MK20-Nano/) online development.

For Arduino, please use this repo.: [nRF51822-Arduino](https://github.com/RedBearLab/nRF51822-Arduino/)

It targets for makers, engineers and students to develop low power Internet-Of-Things (IoT) projects/prototypes quickly and easily.

To update the interface firmware, please refer to the [USB-IF](USB-IF) folder.
